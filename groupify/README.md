# Let's Groupify!
## Chloe, Lily, Will

Our project provides a method to create random and fair (or close to fair) groupings of people, provided inputs of a list of names and a maximum group size.  

For example, if we pass in the list of our 14 names, and ask for a maximum of 4 people per group, the program will return 2 groups of 4, and 2 groups of 3.

## Instructions for use:
1.  From parent directory (where you place the **"groupify"** folder), run the following code on the command line:
- `node groupify/groupify.js groupify/names.txt`
2. You will be prompted to enter a **maximum group size**. Type an *integer* and hit Enter.


*Note: running this program requires the readline-sync module*
